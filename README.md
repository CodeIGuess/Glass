# Glass
Glass is a pixel art engine built on TypeScript and Node.JS

## Modularity
When you load up a Unity web build, it takes a few seconds to load up and start the game. This happens because Unity is a big engine, with lots of useful features that sometimes go unused.

This engine is built entirely out of modules, so it leaves unused code out of the final build.

## Ease of use


## Fast development


## Made for game jams.
It was developed for the first game jam I joined, and has kept growing since then with each game Iâ€™ve made (or, tried making)

# Why TypeScript?
Because JavaScript but I fell in love with typescript so here we are
The internals / externals

I love javascript

# Why another game engine?


# Planned features
 - (Finishing the project)
 - Pruning unused functions
 - Building to WebAssembly (compiling TypeScript to WebAssemblyScript)
